> Reinforcement Learning is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on training agents to make decisions in environments by maximizing a reward signal. This guide will introduce the key concepts essential for Reinforcement Learning, covering Value/Policy Iteration, Q-Learning and Variants, Policy Gradient Methods, etc. We refer to [OpenAI Spinning Up](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/rl_intro.html) and [CMU 16-831](https://16-831.github.io/fall24/) for more details.

### Recap of Markov Decision Processes

A Markov Decision Process (MDP) provides the mathematical framework for modeling decision-making in situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision-maker. An MDP is defined by the following components:

1. **State Space ($\mathcal{S}$)**: The set of all possible states in the environment
   - Each state $s \in \mathcal{S}$ contains all relevant information needed to make decisions
   - The Markov property states that the future only depends on the current state, not the history

2. **Action Space ($\mathcal{A}$)**: The set of all possible actions available to the agent
   - Actions can be discrete (finite set) or continuous
   - The available actions may depend on the current state

3. **Transition Function $P(s'|s,a)$**: The probability of transitioning to state $s'$ when taking action $a$ in state $s$
   - $P: \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A} \times \mathcal{S} \rightarrow [0,1]$
   - Must satisfy $\sum_{s' \in \mathcal{S}} P(s'|s,a) = 1$ for all $s,a$
   - Captures the dynamics of the environment

4. **Reward Function $R(s,a,s')$**: The immediate reward received when transitioning from $s$ to $s'$ via action $a$
   - $R: \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A} \times \mathcal{S} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$
   - Defines the goal/objective for the agent
   - Can also be written as $R(s,a)$ or $R(s)$ depending on dependencies

5. **Discount Factor ($\gamma$)**: A value in $[0,1]$ that determines the importance of future rewards
   - $\gamma = 0$: Myopic evaluation (only immediate rewards matter)
   - $\gamma \rightarrow 1$: Far-sighted evaluation (future rewards are important)
   - Ensures convergence of infinite horizon problems

The goal in an MDP is to find an optimal policy $\pi^*(s)$ that maximizes the expected cumulative discounted reward:

$$
V^*(s) = \max_\pi \mathbb{E}_\pi \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t R(s_t,a_t,s_{t+1}) | s_0 = s \right]
$$

Key Functions:
- **Value Function $V(s)$**: Expected return starting from state $s$
- **Action-Value Function $Q(s,a)$**: Expected return starting from state $s$, taking action $a$
- **Policy $\pi(a|s)$**: Probability distribution over actions given the current state

The optimal policy and value function are related through the Bellman optimality equations:

$$
V^*(s) = \max_a \sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a)[R(s,a,s') + \gamma V^*(s')]
$$

$$
Q^*(s,a) = \sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a)[R(s,a,s') + \gamma \max_{a'} Q^*(s',a')]
$$


### Value/Policy Iteration

Value iteration and policy iteration are fundamental algorithms in reinforcement learning for solving Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). These algorithms aim to find optimal policies in environments with known transition dynamics and reward functions.

#### Value Iteration

Value iteration works by iteratively updating state values using the Bellman optimality equation:

$$
V_{k+1}(s) = \max_a \sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a)[R(s,a,s') + \gamma V_k(s')]
$$

where:
- $V_k(s)$ is the value of state $s$ at iteration $k$
- $P(s'|s,a)$ is the transition probability from state $s$ to $s'$ under action $a$
- $R(s,a,s')$ is the immediate reward
- $\gamma$ is the discount factor
- $\max_a$ finds the action that maximizes expected future value

The algorithm continues until the value function converges (i.e., the maximum change in value between iterations is below a threshold ε). Once converged, the optimal policy can be extracted by:

$$
\pi^*(s) = \arg\max_a \sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a)[R(s,a,s') + \gamma V^*(s')]
$$

#### Policy Iteration

Policy iteration alternates between two steps:

1. **Policy Evaluation**: For a fixed policy π, compute the value function by solving:
   $$
   V^\pi(s) = \sum_{s'} P(s'|s,\pi(s))[R(s,\pi(s),s') + \gamma V^\pi(s')]
   $$
   This is typically done iteratively until convergence.

2. **Policy Improvement**: Update the policy to be greedy with respect to the current value function:
   $$
   \pi_{new}(s) = \arg\max_a \sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a)[R(s,a,s') + \gamma V^\pi(s')]
   $$

The algorithm continues alternating between these steps until the policy no longer changes. Policy iteration is guaranteed to converge to the optimal policy in finite MDPs.

#### Comparison and Practical Considerations

- Value iteration typically requires fewer iterations than policy iteration but does more computation per iteration
- Policy iteration may converge in fewer iterations but requires solving a system of linear equations in each evaluation step
- Modified Policy Iteration (MPI) combines aspects of both by performing partial policy evaluation steps
- In practice, both algorithms may be impractical for large state spaces, leading to approximate versions using function approximation

### Q-Learning and Variants

Q-Learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that learns an action-value function Q(s,a) representing the expected return of taking action a in state s. The core update equation is:

$$
Q(s_t,a_t) \leftarrow Q(s_t,a_t) + \alpha[r_t + \gamma \max_a Q(s_{t+1},a) - Q(s_t,a_t)]
$$

Deep Q-Network (DQN) extends this by using neural networks to approximate the Q-function, adding experience replay and target networks for stability.

### Policy Gradient Methods

Policy gradient methods directly optimize a policy π(a|s) to maximize expected return. The key insight is the policy gradient theorem:

$$
\nabla_\theta J(\pi_\theta) = E_{\tau \sim \pi_\theta}[\sum_t \nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)R(\tau)]
$$

Common algorithms include:
- REINFORCE: The simplest policy gradient algorithm
- PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization): Uses clipped surrogate objective for stable updates
- TRPO (Trust Region Policy Optimization): Ensures policy updates stay within trust regions

### Actor-Critic Methods

Actor-critic methods combine policy gradient approaches with value function approximation. The actor (policy) learns to take actions while the critic (value function) evaluates those actions. This architecture addresses key limitations of pure policy gradient and value-based methods:

- **Reduced Variance**: The critic provides a lower-variance baseline for policy updates compared to Monte Carlo returns
- **Online Updates**: Unlike REINFORCE, actor-critic methods can learn online without waiting for episode completion
- **Structured Exploration**: The actor can learn sophisticated exploration strategies while the critic evaluates their effectiveness

The general update equations for actor-critic methods are:

Critic Update:
$$
\delta_t = r_t + \gamma V(s_{t+1}) - V(s_t) \quad \text{(TD Error)}
$$
$$
\theta_v \leftarrow \theta_v + \alpha_v \delta_t \nabla_{\theta_v} V(s_t)
$$

Actor Update:
$$
\theta_\pi \leftarrow \theta_\pi + \alpha_\pi \delta_t \nabla_{\theta_\pi} \log \pi_{\theta_\pi}(a_t|s_t)
$$

Key algorithms include:

#### A2C/A3C (Advantage Actor-Critic)
- Uses advantage function $A(s,a) = Q(s,a) - V(s)$ to reduce variance
- A3C runs multiple parallel actors for better exploration and stability
- Synchronous (A2C) vs asynchronous (A3C) variants trade off between computational efficiency and stability
- Typical architecture uses shared lower layers between actor and critic networks

#### DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient)
- Designed specifically for continuous action spaces
- Uses deterministic policy gradient theorem: $\nabla_{\theta_\pi} J(\pi_\theta) = E_{s\sim\rho^\pi}[\nabla_a Q(s,a)|_{a=\pi(s)} \nabla_{\theta_\pi} \pi_{\theta_\pi}(s)]$
- Employs target networks and experience replay for stability
- Adds exploration noise (typically Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process) to the deterministic policy
- Architecture includes:
  - Actor network: $\mu(s|\theta^\mu)$
  - Critic network: $Q(s,a|\theta^Q)$
  - Target networks: $\mu'$ and $Q'$ with soft updates

#### SAC (Soft Actor-Critic)
- Maximizes both expected return and policy entropy
- Objective: $J(\pi) = \sum_t E_{(s_t,a_t)\sim\rho_\pi}[r(s_t,a_t) + \alpha H(\pi(\cdot|s_t))]$
- Uses two Q-functions to mitigate overestimation bias
- Automatically tunes temperature parameter $\alpha$ for optimal entropy
- Key components:
  - Soft value function: $V(s_t) = E_{a_t\sim\pi}[Q(s_t,a_t) - \alpha\log\pi(a_t|s_t)]$
  - Soft Q-function: $Q(s_t,a_t) = r_t + \gamma E_{s_{t+1}}[V(s_{t+1})]$
  - Policy: $\pi(a_t|s_t) \propto \exp(\frac{1}{\alpha}Q(s_t,a_t))$

#### TD3 (Twin Delayed DDPG)
- Addresses overestimation bias in DDPG using double Q-learning
- Delays policy updates to reduce variance
- Uses clipped double Q-learning and target policy smoothing
- Particularly effective for complex continuous control tasks

Implementation considerations:
- Network architectures typically use separate networks for actor and critic
- Learning rates often differ between actor and critic ($\alpha_\pi < \alpha_v$)
- Gradient clipping and batch normalization can improve stability
- Experience replay buffer size and batch size significantly impact performance
