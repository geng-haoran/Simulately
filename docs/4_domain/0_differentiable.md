DiffSim is a scalable framework for differentiable physics that can support a large number of objects and their interactions. It adopts meshes as its representation and leverage the sparsity of contacts for scalable differentiable collision handling. Collisions are resolved in localized regions to minimize the number of optimization variables even when the number of simulated objects is high. It further accelerates implicit differentiation of optimization with nonlinear constraints. DiffSim requires up to two orders of magnitude less memory and computation in comparison to contemporary particle-based methods.

DiffArticulated is a method for efficient differentiable simulation of articulated bodies. This enables integration of articulated body dynamics into deep learning frameworks, and gradient-based optimization of neural networks that operate on articulated bodies. The gradients of the contact solver are derived using spatial algebra and the adjoint method, resulting in simulation speed that's an order of magnitude faster than autodiff tools.

DiSECt is a simulator for the cutting of deformable materials. It uses the Finite Element Method (FEM) to simulate the deformation of the material, and leverages a virtual node algorithm to introduce springs between the two halves of the mesh being cut. These cutting springs are weakened in proportion to the knife forces acting on the material, yielding a continuous model of deformation and crack propagation. By leveraging source code transformation, the back-end of DiSECt automatically generates CUDA-accelerated kernels for the forward simulation and the gradients of the simulation inputs. Such gradient information can be used to optimize the simulation parameters to achieve accurate knife force predictions, optimize cutting actions, and more.

DaXBench combines recent advances in deformable object simulation with JAX, a high-performance computational framework. All DOM tasks in DaXBench are wrapped with the OpenAI Gym API for easy integration with DOM algorithms.
